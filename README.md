# Simple Groq Chatbot

This project is a simple AI chatbot application built with Flask and Groq. The chatbot provides an interactive interface where users can send messages and receive AI-generated responses powered by Groq's API.

## Features

- **Chat Interface**: Clean, modern chat interface with support for both light and dark themes.
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between dark and light modes dynamically.
- **Markdown Support**: The chatbot can interpret and display markdown content for rich responses.
- **Flask Backend**: A Python Flask server that handles requests and interacts with the Groq API to generate chatbot responses.
- **Groq AI Model**: Utilizes Groq's AI model `moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct-0905` to generate meaningful replies.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML
  - CSS (with custom styles for light and dark mode)
  - JavaScript (for dynamic chat interactions)
  - Bootstrap (for responsive design)
  - Font Awesome (for icons)

- **Backend**:
  - Python
  - Flask (for handling HTTP requests)
  - Groq API (for generating AI responses)
  - dotenv (for managing environment variables)

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the chatbot running locally:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Node.js (for managing any front-end dependencies)
- Flask
- Groq API key (you will need to sign up for Groq and get your API key)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MuhammadMaheem/Simple-Groq-Chatbot.git
   cd Simple-Groq-Chatbot
  ```

2. **Install required Python packages**:
   Create a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies.

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your Groq API key:

   ```bash
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
   ```

4. **Run the Flask app**:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The app should now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

5. **Open the chatbot**:
   Open a browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to interact with the chatbot.

## Usage

1. Type a message in the chat input field.
2. Press `Enter` or click the **Send** button to send the message.
3. The chatbot will process the message and reply with a response generated by the Groq AI model.
4. Use the **Theme Toggle** button to switch between dark and light themes.
